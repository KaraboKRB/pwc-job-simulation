CAUSE ANALYSIS: UNDERSTANDING AND APPLYING INTEGRATED DEFENCE IN CYBERSECURITY
OVERVIEW
A cause analysis is a methodical approach to identifying the root causes or underlying reasons behind a specific event or issue. In cybersecurity, cause analysis helps us address vulnerabilities, prevent recurring incidents, and enhance processes and systems.

OBJECTIVES OF THE TASK
In this task, I focused on learning the following:

1.Recognizing Information Security Dangers and Biases: Identifying potential threats and cognitive biases that may impact decision-making.
2.Differentiating Between Due Care and Due Diligence in Risk Management: Understanding these key concepts and their application to security practices.
3.Explaining Integrated Defence to Boldi AG: Communicating the importance of an integrated defence strategy.
4.Assessing Boldi AG's Security Practices: Evaluating their adherence to due care and due diligence.
5.Describing Basic Risk Limitation Options: Explaining the principles of Deter, Detect, Prevent, and Avoid.
6.Offering Cybersecurity Attack Response Recommendations: Proposing practical solutions for mitigating cyber threats.


PART 1: DUE CARE VS. DUE DILIGENCE

Due Care
Refers to the responsibility and standard of care an organization or individual takes to protect assets and data.
It involves proactively identifying risks and implementing measures to address them.

Due Diligence
Refers to continuous monitoring and assessment to ensure that due care practices are effective and being followed.
Involves inspecting, auditing, and monitoring systems, policies, and personnel to verify compliance and effectiveness.

Analysis of Boldi AG's Security Practices
Based on my understanding and applied skills:

Issue with Due Diligence:
Boldi AG backed up their images and files but failed to monitor or test these backups regularly. Without consistent monitoring, there's no certainty that the data remains unaltered or intact. This compromises data integrity, a cornerstone of cybersecurity.
Possible Issue with Due Care:
Due care also requires identifying risks to the data they have backed up. If Boldi AG did not thoroughly assess and address these risks, they may have fallen short in this area as well.
Regular monitoring and testing of backup systems are essential to ensure data integrity and resilience against manipulation or corruption.

PART 2: COMMUNICATING RISK LIMITATION OPTIONS
In part 2 to I had to wite an email to the management to explain the following :

Deter:

To deter is to discourage malicious actions by instilling doubt or fear about the consequences.
Example: Installing surveillance cameras in buildings storing critical information acts as a deterrent to unauthorized access.

Detect:
Detection involves identifying threats or malicious activities within your system.
Example: Using antivirus software to detect and neutralize malware before it causes harm.

Prevent:
Prevention focuses on stopping issues before they occur.
Example: Implementing strong password policies or locking server rooms to prevent unauthorized access.

Avoid:
Avoidance involves steering clear of specific risks entirely. Example: Avoiding the use of unsupported or outdated software minimizes vulnerabilities to exploitation.


RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOLDI AG'S CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES
Regularly test and monitor backup systems to ensure data integrity and availability.
Conduct routine audits of security measures to maintain compliance with due care and due diligence.
Implement a layered defence strategy combining deterrence, detection, prevention, and avoidance.
Provide ongoing cybersecurity training for employees to recognize and respond to threats effectively.
This document serves as a foundational analysis for understanding and addressing cybersecurity challenges. It highlights the importance of integrating multiple defensive measures while maintaining a proactive approach to risk management.
